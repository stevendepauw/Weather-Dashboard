## Installation

## Usage
The user can enter the name of a city that they would like to find the current and future weather for. Once the name is entered, the api will take the city name and provide longtitude and latitude coordiantes for it which will then provide a 5 day forcast for the city as well as the weather for the current day. Past searches will be stored in local storage so that the search history buttons can be reloaded when the page loads.
